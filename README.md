# Common Object Pooler
This code is written for use for the Unity3d game engine in C#. It contains an Object Pooler, and Pool controller, script for pooling with said pooler, and persistent object properties in form of ScriptableObject derived class. Just put the PoolController on any GameObject in your scene, and derive your game's objects from PoolableObject, possibly building on it from there. It will automatically add itself to the PoolController's pools on Awake().
