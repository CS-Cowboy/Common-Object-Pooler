# Project_GR
A few bits of code both as portfolio from an in-progress project of mine. This code is written for use in the Unity3d game engine. It contains an Object Pooler, and Pool controller, associated base object script, and attributes script. Just put the PoolController on any GameObject in your scene, and derive your game's objects from BaseObject. It will automatically add itself to the PoolController's pools on Awake(). 

# Regarding copying (this is for you, Github user):
I don't mind if you clone or copy this repo, and in fact I'd be honored. This now exists as a portfolio piece but its also part of Project_GR. Hope you'll get some use out of it! :)
