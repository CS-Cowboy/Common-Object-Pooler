# Common Object Pooler
This code is written for use for the Unity3d game engine in C#. It contains an Object Pooler, and Pool controller, script for pooling with said pooler, and persisten object properties in form of ScriptableObject derived class. Just put the PoolController on any GameObject in your scene, and derive your game's objects from PoolableObject, possibly building on it from there. It will automatically add itself to the PoolController's pools on Awake(). 

# Regarding copying (this is for you, Github user):
I don't mind if you clone or copy this repo, and in fact I'd be honored. This now exists as a portfolio piece but its also part of Project_GR. Hope you'll get some use out of it! :)

May the sun be always in your face and the wind always at your back, partner ;)
